>While it's interesting to play around with, this isn't a very good tool for studying physical systems. There are far more accurate integration methods which can be used (this uses the most basic one possible, [Euler-Cromer Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-implicit_Euler_method)), not to mention you'd want to be able to very carefully set initial conditions. That way you can do things like make the net momentum 0, so the system as a whole stays in one place, as well as putting the bodies on roughly circular orbits.
